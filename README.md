This is the code for lecast data mining competition. 

It may not be possible to run the code on your own PC, due to environment settings (such as database or dlls). 

I'v attached all the output files the code generated, including some temporal files and final output csv file.

The submitted document is also available. 

If you have any question, please feel free to contact me via email (daihanjun@gmail.com).
